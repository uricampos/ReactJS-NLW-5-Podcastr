# ReactJS-NLW-5-Podcastr

This project was made in Next Level Week 5 with the Rocetseat team.

Was used ReactJS, Next.js and Typescript.

The idea of this project was to teach new things about the technologies listed above and make a podcast website, consuming a prepared API that was made by the team.

Thanks for letting me learn new stuff, Rocktseat!
